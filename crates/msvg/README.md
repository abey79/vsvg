# *msvg*

This crate is part of the [*vsvg* project](https://github.com/abey79/vsvg).

**Status**: On the TODO list

## What's this?

Compared to *vpype*, *vsvg* is *extremely* fast to load and display SVGs. This opens up the prospect of a tool that can load a whole bunch of SVGs (e.g. many realisations of a generative art algorithm) and quickly browse/display them (e.g. to pick up the best realisation). This is what *msvg* will be. Currently, it's just an empty shell though.
